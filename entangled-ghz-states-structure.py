# üß™ Experiment: Testing Structured Decoherence in GHZ or W States
# ===========================================================
# This experiment tests how different types of quantum noise affect a 3 or more qubit GHZ or W states.
#
# ‚úÖ Goals:
#    - Create a GHZ state: (|000‚ü© + |111‚ü©) / ‚àö2 (or other states like W or G-CRY).
#    - Introduce various types of quantum noise: depolarizing, phase flip, amplitude damping, or phase damping.
#    - Observe error propagation and determine if errors follow structured patterns instead of being purely random.
#
# üîç Key Questions:
#    - Do errors appear in correlated pairs, hinting at entanglement constraints?
#    - Does the noise preserve some symmetry rather than acting randomly?
#    - How does entanglement influence the way decoherence spreads?
#
# üéØ Expected Results:
#    - Without noise: The ideal state (e.g., GHZ) should produce only two outcomes: |000‚ü© and |111‚ü©.
#    - With noise: Additional states or altered coherences appear, with differences based on the noise type.
#
# üöÄ Why This Matters:
#    - If noise follows a geometric constraint, it could reshape models for quantum error correction.
#    - Understanding how entangled states decay under various noise channels is critical for developing
#      fault-tolerant quantum computing techniques.
#
# üõ† Additional Functionality:
#    - The experiment now accepts a SIM_MODE parameter:
#         * "qasm": Uses the qasm_simulator, including measurement operations to yield a classical
#           distribution (histogram) of outcomes.
#         * "density": Uses the density matrix simulation method (via AerSimulator) to output the full density matrix of the state.
#    - An extra noise type, PHASE_DAMPING, has been added to model dephasing effects that reduce
#      the off-diagonal elements of the state without altering populations.
#
# üìñ Usage:
#    python <script> NUM_QUBITS STATE_TYPE NOISE_TYPE NOISE_ENABLED SHOTS SIM_MODE
#
#    - NUM_QUBITS: Number of qubits (default 3).
#    - STATE_TYPE: "GHZ", "W", or "G-CRY" (default GHZ).
#    - NOISE_TYPE: "DEPOLARIZING", "PHASE_FLIP", "AMPLITUDE_DAMPING", or "PHASE_DAMPING" (default DEPOLARIZING).
#    - NOISE_ENABLED: "true" or "false" (default true).
#    - SHOTS: Number of shots (default 1024).
#    - SIM_MODE: "qasm" for measurement-based simulation or "density" for full density matrix output (default "qasm").
#
#    Example:
#       python script.py 3 GHZ DEPOLARIZING false 1024 density
#
# ‚úÖ Notes:
#    - When using SIM_MODE = "density", measurement operations are removed and a save instruction is added so that the full state (density matrix)
#      can be observed. This is useful for analyzing coherence and mixedness directly.
#    - For measurement-based simulations (SIM_MODE = "qasm"), the circuit includes measurement gates, and you will
#      see a histogram of outcomes.

# ‚úÖ Observations:
# - Without noise: The GHZ state should only produce |000‚ü© and |111‚ü© in equal probability.
# - With depolarizing noise: Additional states appear due to random bit flips.
# - With phase flip noise: The phase of the quantum state is affected, influencing interference patterns.
# - If noise is structured rather than random, this suggests an underlying constraint in decoherence.

# ‚úÖ Why This Matters:
# - If decoherence patterns are **not completely random**, it could mean entanglement imposes geometric constraints.
# - Investigating these structured patterns could improve **quantum error correction** methods.
# - Further experiments could explore **other noise types** (amplitude damping, thermal noise) to see if they follow similar patterns.

# ‚úÖ Observations of Depolarizing Noise:
# - The expected GHZ distribution (50% |000‚ü©, 50% |111‚ü©) **breaks down**, and we see other states appearing.
# - The **errors seem to occur in correlated pairs** (e.g., |010‚ü©, |101‚ü©, |110‚ü©), rather than a fully random spread.
# - This suggests that even though depolarizing noise is **random at the gate level**, the entanglement structure still influences how errors propagate.
# - If the noise were truly random, we would expect a fully uniform distribution of all possible states.
# - Instead, the structure of entanglement appears to **bias the probability of errors**, meaning **decoherence might follow deeper constraints**.

# ‚úÖ Observations of Phase Flip Noise:
# - Before applying Hadamard gates, the state remains **stuck** in |000‚ü© and |111‚ü©, since phase errors do not affect measurement in the computational basis.
# - After applying Hadamard gates, **the expected GHZ pattern disappears** and is replaced by an equal mix of |000‚ü©, |011‚ü©, |101‚ü©, and |110‚ü©.
# - This confirms that **phase flip errors transform into bit flips** when measured in the Hadamard basis.
# - **No single state dominates**, suggesting that phase flips affect all components of the superposition equally.
# - If phase flip errors were purely random, we might expect a fully uniform distribution across all 8 possible states, but **only 4 dominate**, hinting at a structured transformation of errors.
# - The symmetry of error distribution indicates that **entanglement plays a role in error propagation**, even when dealing with phase errors.

# ‚úÖ Observations of Amplitude Damping Noise:
# - **Without Hadamard transformation:**
#   - The GHZ state was **mostly preserved** because **amplitude damping primarily affects qubits in |1‚ü©**.
#   - There was a **slight bias toward |0‚ü©**, meaning the system **prefers the ground state**.
# - **After applying Hadamards:**
#   - The GHZ pattern **decomposed** into **four states**:
#     **|000‚ü©, |011‚ü©, |101‚ü©, |110‚ü©**.
#   - **Same even-parity structure as phase flip noise**, but with a slight **bias toward |0‚ü©**.
# - **Key Feature:** Unlike depolarizing or phase flip noise, **amplitude damping represents irreversible energy loss**, which leads to a **slow drift toward the ground state**.
# - **The same parity constraints still hold**, meaning **error propagation is structured, not purely random**.


# ‚úÖ Observations of Amplitude Damping Noise vs Phase Flip Noise:
# - Both noise types **preserve even parity**, meaning errors **do not spread randomly across all 8 states**.
# - **Phase flip noise:**
#   - Only **affects phase relationships** but does **not cause energy loss**.
#   - Hadamard transformation converts these **hidden errors into measurable bit flips**.
# - **Amplitude damping noise:**
#   - Represents **energy decay** rather than just phase shifts.
#   - Causes a **slight bias toward |0‚ü©**, meaning **states closer to the ground state become more probable**.
# - **Both noise models result in a nearly even spread** among **4 states (|000‚ü©, |011‚ü©, |101‚ü©, |110‚ü©)**, showing that **entanglement constrains how errors propagate**.

# ‚úÖ Latest Findings: W-State Error Propagation
# - We tested the effect of **phase flip noise** and **depolarizing noise** on the W-state.
# - The W-state showed structured error propagation, similar to GHZ states, but with key differences.

# ‚úÖ Observations of Depolarizing Noise on the W-State:
# - Unlike GHZ states, the W-state maintains **a uniform distribution** among |100‚ü©, |010‚ü©, and |001‚ü©.
# - This suggests that **depolarization does not fully disrupt the W-state‚Äôs structure**, but spreads the noise evenly.
# - **Key takeaway**: The W-state appears more **robust** to depolarization than GHZ states, as entanglement is distributed across multiple qubits.

# ‚úÖ Observations of Phase Flip Noise on the W-State:
# - The W-state exhibits a strong bias toward **|000‚ü© and |111‚ü©**, with error pairs appearing in specific patterns.
# - This suggests that **phase errors introduce decoherence in a structured way**, similar to GHZ states.
# - The pattern indicates that **entanglement constraints still govern the way phase errors propagate**.
# - **Key takeaway**: The W-state does not resist phase flip errors as strongly as depolarizing noise but still follows structured decoherence.

# ‚úÖ Key Insights from the Experiments:
# - **Entanglement constrains noise propagation** in both GHZ and W-states, leading to structured error patterns.
# - The W-state is **more resilient to depolarization** but **still sensitive to phase flips**.
# - **Further research:** Investigate how **amplitude damping noise** affects W-states to determine energy loss behavior.
# - These results could help **optimize quantum error correction methods** that exploit entanglement structure.


# ‚úÖ What This Could Mean:
# - **Entanglement does not simply "store" quantum information‚Äîit also dictates how errors spread through the system**.
# - **Quantum noise might not be purely random**, but instead follow **hidden constraints** dictated by the underlying quantum correlations.
# - These results suggest that we could explore **error correction techniques that exploit entanglement structure**, rather than treating errors as purely probabilistic.
# - Testing this across **different types of noise** (e.g., amplitude damping, thermal noise) could confirm whether decoherence is **geometrically constrained**.
