# üß™ Experiment: Testing Structured Decoherence in GHZ States
# ===========================================================
# This experiment tests how different types of quantum noise affect a 3-qubit GHZ state.
#
# ‚úÖ Goal:
#    - Create a GHZ state: (|000‚ü© + |111‚ü©) / ‚àö2
#    - Introduce depolarizing or phase flip noise and observe error propagation.
#    - Determine if errors appear randomly or follow a structured pattern.
#
# üîç Key Questions:
#    - Do errors appear in **correlated pairs**, hinting at entanglement constraints?
#    - Does the noise **preserve some symmetry**, instead of acting randomly?
#    - How does entanglement influence the way decoherence spreads?
#
# üéØ Expected Results:
#    - **Without noise** ‚Üí Only two states should appear: |000‚ü© and |111‚ü©.
#    - **With depolarizing noise** ‚Üí Additional states (e.g., |010‚ü©, |101‚ü©) may appear.
#    - If errors are structured, we should see **specific error patterns** instead of fully random noise.
#
# üöÄ Why This Matters:
#    - If noise follows a **geometric constraint**, this could reshape how we model quantum error correction.
#    - Understanding error propagation in entangled systems is key for improving fault-tolerant quantum computing.

    # - Phase flip errors affect the **relative phase** between |000‚ü© and |111‚ü©,
    #   but these errors are **not visible** in the computational (Z) basis.
    # - Applying Hadamard gates **transforms phase errors into bit-flip errors**,
    #   making them measurable in the standard basis.
    # - This works because the Hadamard gate swaps:
    #     |0‚ü© ‚Üí (|0‚ü© + |1‚ü©) / ‚àö2
    #     |1‚ü© ‚Üí (|0‚ü© - |1‚ü©) / ‚àö2

# ‚úÖ Observations:
# - Without noise: The GHZ state should only produce |000‚ü© and |111‚ü© in equal probability.
# - With depolarizing noise: Additional states appear due to random bit flips.
# - With phase flip noise: The phase of the quantum state is affected, influencing interference patterns.
# - If noise is structured rather than random, this suggests an underlying constraint in decoherence.

# ‚úÖ Why This Matters:
# - If decoherence patterns are **not completely random**, it could mean entanglement imposes geometric constraints.
# - Investigating these structured patterns could improve **quantum error correction** methods.
# - Further experiments could explore **other noise types** (amplitude damping, thermal noise) to see if they follow similar patterns.

# ‚úÖ Observations of Depolarizing Noise:
# - The expected GHZ distribution (50% |000‚ü©, 50% |111‚ü©) **breaks down**, and we see other states appearing.
# - The **errors seem to occur in correlated pairs** (e.g., |010‚ü©, |101‚ü©, |110‚ü©), rather than a fully random spread.
# - This suggests that even though depolarizing noise is **random at the gate level**, the entanglement structure still influences how errors propagate.
# - If the noise were truly random, we would expect a fully uniform distribution of all possible states.
# - Instead, the structure of entanglement appears to **bias the probability of errors**, meaning **decoherence might follow deeper constraints**.

# ‚úÖ Observations of Phase Flip Noise:
# - Before applying Hadamard gates, the state remains **stuck** in |000‚ü© and |111‚ü©, since phase errors do not affect measurement in the computational basis.
# - After applying Hadamard gates, **the expected GHZ pattern disappears** and is replaced by an equal mix of |000‚ü©, |011‚ü©, |101‚ü©, and |110‚ü©.
# - This confirms that **phase flip errors transform into bit flips** when measured in the Hadamard basis.
# - **No single state dominates**, suggesting that phase flips affect all components of the superposition equally.
# - If phase flip errors were purely random, we might expect a fully uniform distribution across all 8 possible states, but **only 4 dominate**, hinting at a structured transformation of errors.
# - The symmetry of error distribution indicates that **entanglement plays a role in error propagation**, even when dealing with phase errors.

# ‚úÖ Observations of Amplitude Damping Noise:
# - **Without Hadamard transformation:**
#   - The GHZ state was **mostly preserved** because **amplitude damping primarily affects qubits in |1‚ü©**.
#   - There was a **slight bias toward |0‚ü©**, meaning the system **prefers the ground state**.
# - **After applying Hadamards:**
#   - The GHZ pattern **decomposed** into **four states**:  
#     **|000‚ü©, |011‚ü©, |101‚ü©, |110‚ü©**.
#   - **Same even-parity structure as phase flip noise**, but with a slight **bias toward |0‚ü©**.
# - **Key Feature:** Unlike depolarizing or phase flip noise, **amplitude damping represents irreversible energy loss**, which leads to a **slow drift toward the ground state**.
# - **The same parity constraints still hold**, meaning **error propagation is structured, not purely random**.


# ‚úÖ Observations of Amplitude Damping Noise vs Phase Flip Noise:
# - Both noise types **preserve even parity**, meaning errors **do not spread randomly across all 8 states**.
# - **Phase flip noise:**
#   - Only **affects phase relationships** but does **not cause energy loss**.  
#   - Hadamard transformation converts these **hidden errors into measurable bit flips**.
# - **Amplitude damping noise:**
#   - Represents **energy decay** rather than just phase shifts.  
#   - Causes a **slight bias toward |0‚ü©**, meaning **states closer to the ground state become more probable**.
# - **Both noise models result in a nearly even spread** among **4 states (|000‚ü©, |011‚ü©, |101‚ü©, |110‚ü©)**, showing that **entanglement constrains how errors propagate**.

# ‚úÖ What This Could Mean:
# - **Entanglement does not simply "store" quantum information‚Äîit also dictates how errors spread through the system**.
# - **Quantum noise might not be purely random**, but instead follow **hidden constraints** dictated by the underlying quantum correlations.
# - These results suggest that we could explore **error correction techniques that exploit entanglement structure**, rather than treating errors as purely probabilistic.
# - Testing this across **different types of noise** (e.g., amplitude damping, thermal noise) could confirm whether decoherence is **geometrically constrained**.
